Binge
##
With Hollywood taking less and less risks in recent years with original ideas,
streaming services like Netflix and Hbo Max are constantly being filled with new movies and shows every week!
Binge is a program that helps the user decide what to watch next. It can also save the users favorites
as well as keep track of their watched history, all in their own respective page.
 
The program even has the ability to show what movies are playing at the user's location
 
No longer does the user have to pause and think if they seen a movie when asked, they can just pull out the Binge movie companion!
